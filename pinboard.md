# ideas

- lightning strike that makes the screen go white. the silhouettes of actors are shown in black. enemy actors have the default sprite, but party membersâ€™ silhouettes look like their tools standing upright
- attack animation:
	1. perform windup, start the strike
	2. halt abruptly right before collision
	3. roll dice for damage
	4. smash into the target, deal damage
- draw a shape with an actor's path to execute certain attacks
	- a la persona 5 tactica's triangle for all out attacks
- move that causes the grid to "disappear" for a few seconds, actors can move freely
- dark environment, can't see
- too-bright environment, can only see shadows (or, more complicated: can only see silhouettes of things that are between you and the light source)
- underwater arena, moving schools of fish impede movement
- standing horizontally on walls, mc escher style


# crafts

- gardening (slow but steady growth, death, contribution to ecosystem)
- woodcarving (chipping off parts)
- origami (folding down infinitely, frailty, prettiness)
- painting (layers upon layers, covering base objects)
