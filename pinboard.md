# ideas

- draw a shape with an actor's path to execute certain attacks
	- a la persona 5 tactica's triangle for all out attacks
- move that causes the grid to "disappear" for a few seconds, actors can move freely
- dark environment, can't see
- too-bright environment, can only see shadows (or, more complicated: can only see silhouettes of things that are between you and the light source)
- underwater arena, moving schools of fish impede movement
- standing horizontally on walls, mc escher style
